            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an 
            Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.
            Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering.
            He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and 
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's 
            civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile 
            Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
            He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
            the first since the original nuclear 
            test by India in 1974.
        <br>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram 
            on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat
            owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
            His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
         <br><Br>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar 
            traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found 
            in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. 
            The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka,
            as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914,
            however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. 
            The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's 
            meager income.

            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire
            to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After completing his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary 
            School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954
            
            Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior
            class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished
            within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking 
            you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in
            qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.<br><br>

            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research
            and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
            Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
            Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by
            H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian 
            Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed
            the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
            In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

        <p>Rani Lakshmibai (or Rani Lakshmi Bai) was born on 19 November 1828 (some sources say 1835) in the town of Banares (now Varanasi) into
            a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family.She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi
            Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Her
            mother died when she was five years old. Her father was a Commander during the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district.
            The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "beautiful " and "lively and cheerful". She was educated at home and was taught to read and write, and was more 
            independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting, horsemanship, fencing and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana 
            Sahib and Tantia Tope[dubious - discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at this time.
            And she was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to fight against social norms even in front of the whole society.<br><br>
            Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the palace and the temple, although sometimes she was carried in a palanquin.
            Her horses included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according to historians, she rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858. Her palace, the Rani Mahal, has now been
            converted into a museum.It houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th centuries AD.

                On 17 June in Kotah-ki-Serai near the Phool Bagh of Gwalior, a squadron of the 8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars, under Captain Heneage, fought the 
                large Indian force commanded by Rani Lakshmibai, who was trying to leave the area. The 8th Hussars charged into the Indian force, slaughtering 5,000 
                Indian soldiers, including any Indian "over the age of 16".[42] They took two guns and continued the charge right through the Phool Bagh encampment. 
                In this engagement, according to an eyewitness account, Rani Lakshmibai put on a sowar's uniform and attacked one of the hussars; she was unhorsed and
                also wounded, probably by his saber. Shortly afterward, as she sat bleeding by the roadside, she recognized the soldier and fired at him with a pistol,
                whereupon he "dispatched the young lady with his carbine".[43][44] According to another tradition Rani Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi, dressed as a 
                cavalry leader, was badly wounded; not wishing the British to capture her body, she told a hermit to burn it. After her death, a few local people
                cremated her body.
    
               The British captured the city of Gwalior after three days. In the British report of this battle, Hugh Rose commented that Rani Lakshmibai is "personable,
               clever and beautiful" and she is "the most dangerous of all Indian leaders".
            <br>
               According to a memoir purporting to be by 'Damodar Rao', the young prince was among his mother's troops and household at the battle of Gwalior.
                Together with others who had survived the battle (about 60 retainers with 60 camels and 22 horses), he fled from the camp of Rao Sahib of Bithur 
                and as the village people of Bundelkhand dared not aid them for fear of reprisals from the British, they were forced to live in the forest and suffer
                 many privations. <br><br>After two years there were about 12 survivors and these, together with another group of 24 they encountered, sought the city of
                  Jhalrapatan where there were yet more refugees from Jhansi. Damodar Rao of Jhansi surrendered himself to a British official and his memoir ends 
                  in May 1860. He was then allowed a pension of Rs. 10,000, seven retainers, and was in the guardianship of Munshi Dharmanarayan. The whole memoir
                   was published in Marathi in Kelkar, Y. N. (1959) Itihasachyaaa Sahali ("Voyages in History"). This text is likely a written version based on tales 
                   of the prince's life in oral circulation and what happened to him remains unknown. [citation needed]</p>

        <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]

            During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.[2]
            
            Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural</p>
